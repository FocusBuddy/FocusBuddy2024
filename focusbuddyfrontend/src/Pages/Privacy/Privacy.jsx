        The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection
        practices of FOCUSBUDDY INC, “COMPANY,” “we” or “us”. Specifically, it
        outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are
        using the focusbuddy.com website, application, and other applications
        and platforms that you may access through our website and application
        (the “Site”) and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy
        Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to
        any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline
        and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone,
        or through the mail). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By
        visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use, and any dispute
        over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an
        evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point
        in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy
        Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to
        reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we
        post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
        FocusBuddy Inc strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
        Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
        experience. We may use personally identifiable information (your name,
        e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms
        of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email
        address to any unauthorized third party. “Period.”

        How We Gather Information From Users
      </h2>
      <p className="text-formgray text-md xl:text-lg">
        How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
        visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate in and the
        services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
        when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
        certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You
        may provide information when you participate in surveys, sweepstakes and
        contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of
        our site. When you provide us with your email address, we will send you
        periodic emails or advertising. We may add your email address to other
        electronic platforms we use to target our audience and enhance your user
        experience with our website, products and services. Generally, we will
        ask you to indicate whether or not you want to receive certain types of
        communication from us, and we will adhere to your preferences unless we
        consider a particular communication to be absolutely necessary. Emails
        and advertising will contain a link at the bottom to be removed from our
        list. Like most Web sites, FocusBuddy also collects information
        automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
        transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log your Internet
        Protocol address (“IP address”), the name of your Internet Service
        Provider or use cookie technology, such as conversion and tracking
        pixels, to recognize you and hold information from your visit or from
        your visit to a third party site. Among other things, the cookie may
        store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter
        that information each time you visit, or to the extent applicable may
        control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement
        while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also
        gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose
        not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser
        to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
        certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
        and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features
        according to your preferences. Without limiting the generality of the
        foregoing, we may collect information as follows: 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A. Account and Transaction Information We may collect information when you create an
        account, such as name, email address, telephone number, professional
        details, payment information, and other profile information you choose
        to provide, including information you provide by linking other data
        sources, integrations, or similar services to FocusBuddy. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        B. Your Communications with Us We may collect personal information, such as
        email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request
        information about our Service, attend or request customer or technical
        support, or otherwise communicate with us. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        C. Surveys We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be
        asked to provide certain information which may include personal
        information. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        D. Interactive Features We and others who use our services
        may collect personal information or other information that you submit or
        make available through our and other third party’s interactive features
        (e.g. collaboration tools, messaging and chat features, commenting
        functionalities, forums, blogs, social media pages, and the like). Any
        information you provide on the public sections of these features will be
        considered “public,” unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is
        not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        E.Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events We may collect information
        from individuals when we attend conferences, trade shows, and other
        events. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        F. Business Development and Strategic Partnerships. We may
        collect personal information and other information from individuals and
        third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        G.Job Applications We may post job openings and opportunities on our Site.
        If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV
        and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to
        assess your qualifications.

        How We Protect Your Information
      </h2>
      <p className="text-formgray text-md xl:text-lg">
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
        your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or
        access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.
        All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure
        Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment
        gateway providers’ database only to be accessible by those authorized
        with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the
        information confidential. However, no security program is foolproof, and
        thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other
        information, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we
        do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure. By using our
        services or providing information to us, you agree that we may
        communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and
        administrative issues relating to your use of our services. If we learn
        of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you
        electronically by posting a notice on our services, by mail or by
        sending an email to you.

        Do We Use Cookies?

      <p className="text-formgray text-md xl:text-lg">
        Yes. (Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
        transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you
        allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize
        your browser and capture and remember certain information.) We use
        cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and
        compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that
        we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may

        What Do We Do With The Information We Collect?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-formgray text-md xl:text-lg">
        Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
        and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We do not sell,
        trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally
        identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties
        who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or
        servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information
        confidential. We may also release your information when we are required
        to comply by law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others
        rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable
        visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing,
        advertising, or other uses. Aggregated Information (information that
        does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example,
        we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar
        information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and
        services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
        are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared
        with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does
        not include any personally identifiable information about you or allow
        anyone to identify you individually. We may use Personally Identifiable
        Information collected on FocusBuddy to communicate with you about your
        registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and
        privacy policy; services and products offered by FocusBuddy and other
        topics we think you might find of interest. Personally Identifiable
        Information collected by FocusBuddy may also be used for other purposes,
        including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,
        processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and
        contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who
        provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting
        service for example) may access such information. We will use your
        information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as
        we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner
        with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
        information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose
        your information in response to a court order, at other times when we
        believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with
        the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement
        authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we
        may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

        Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites and Advertisements
      </h2>
      <p className="text-formgray text-md xl:text-lg">
        FocusBuddy expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect
        the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,
        including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
        providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and
        data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit
        to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on FocusBuddy
        pages, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third
        party. Also, through FocusBuddy you may be introduced to, or be able to
        access, information, surveys, Web sites, features, contests or
        sweepstakes offered by other parties. FocusBuddy is not responsible for
        the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the
        applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
        information on a feature or page operated by a third party. While on our
        site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may
        use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
        preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
        advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
        enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
        advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
        services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other
        technology to gather information. FocusBuddy does not control the use of
        this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and are
        not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You
        should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
        Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
        information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by
        third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
        messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
        beyond the control of FocusBuddy and this policy.

        Children’s Privacy Statement
      </h2>
      <p className="text-formgray text-md xl:text-lg">
        This children’s privacy statement explains our practices with respect to
        the online collection and use of personal information from children
        under the age of seventeen, and provides important information regarding
        their rights under federal law with respect to such information. This
        Site is not directed to children under the age of seventeen and we do
        NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
        under the age of seventeen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish
        to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age
        of seventeen from providing such information. If we become aware that we
        have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a
        user under the age of seventeen as part of the Site, we will delete such
        information from our records. If we change our practices in the future,
        we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any
        personally identifiable information from children under the age of
        seventeen as part of the Site. Because we do not collect any personally
        identifiable information from children under the age of seventeen as
        part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information
        to third parties. We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of
        seventeen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally
        identifiable contact information through the Site. We do not collect any
        personally identifiable information from children under the age of
        seventeen as part of the Site, allow the participation of a child under
        seventeen in the Site’s online activities, or allow a child under
        seventeen to provide personally identifiable information.

        Information. You can
        request information about how we have collected, used and shared your
        personal information during the past 12 months. We have made this
        information available to California residents without having to request
        it by including it in this Privacy Policy, in the chart above. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Access.
        You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain
        about you. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Deletion. You delete all the personal information collected
        or maintained about you by deleting your account. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Please note that the
        CCPA and CPRA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from
        providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request
        and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion
        request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to
        you. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from
        discrimination. The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the
        individual submitting a request to access or delete Personal Information
        before providing a substantive response to the request.
